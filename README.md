## Introduction

Introducing LifePal, your machine learning powered life companion. 

We believe that maintaining good health is vital for overall well-being. It is essential to prioritize basic needs such as sleep, nutrition, and hydration in order to take care of one's health.

Leveraging Apple's HealthKit, LifePal utilizes the capabilities of machine learning to generate personalized recommendations for food, water intake, and bedtime. This integration enables LifePal to provide tailored suggestions based on individual health data.

## Features
### Food Recommendation

By analyzing the user's health data and goals, LifePal suggests suitable food options from the menu. Additionally, it presents the complete menu to the user if they wish to explore other choices.
